# Important information

The `UCL-CPUM-H7-1` board is **obsolete** and should not be used as reference. It was a prototype using LPDDR instead of LPSDR.

The `UCL-CPUM-H7-2` is the reference board. For the people who are using the physical board, this folder contains the corresponding resources.

The `UCL-MB-802154RT-1` board corresponds to the physical board. It however contains mistakes and should not be used as a reference though.

The `UCL-MB-802154RT-2` board fixes the mistakes of the first version and should be used as a reference design. It **does not correspond to the physical board**.

# For physical boards users

The people that are using the real board that have been assembled during the thesis must use the `UCL-MB-802154RT-1` and `UCL-CPUM-H7-2` designs. They must be aware that the **USB connector is very fragile** and thus must avoid frequent connecting/disconnecting the micro-USB connector.
